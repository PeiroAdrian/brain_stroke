# üß† Brain Stroke Prediction
## For didactic purposes
This project serves as the final assignment for the Data Mining and Fundamentals of Data Science course at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Hermosillo. It showcases the implementation of two predictive models, decision tree and KNN, to assess the probability of a patient experiencing a stroke using input features.

## In collaboration with Clinica del Noroeste
This project was developed in collaboration with Clinica del Noroeste, a medical center located in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, to ensure the validity and reliability of the information used and to support the development of the predictive model.

## Introduction
Stroke is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the third leading cause of disability. In the United States, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, with an estimated 5.4 million stroke survivors currently alive today. The global burden of stroke is substantial, and it is increasing. Stroke is a complex disease with multiple causes. Some treatable risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, and physical inactivity. Some risk factors for stroke cannot be changed, such as age, hered

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on the input features. The model will be trained on a dataset that contains information about patients

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset. The dataset contains 4981 observations and 11 columns.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:
- `id`: unique identifier
- `gender`:
- `age`: age of the patient
- `hypertension`: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
- `heart_disease`: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
- `ever_married`: "No" or "Yes"
- `work_type`: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
- `Residence_type`: "Rural" or "Urban"
- `avg_glucose_level`: average glucose level in blood
- `bmi`: body mass index
- `smoking_status`: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
- `stroke`: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

## Methodology
The project will be developed in Python using the following libraries:
- `pandas`: data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: numerical computing
- `matplotlib`: data visualization
- `seaborn`: data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: machine learning library

The project will be divided into the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Development
6. Model Evaluation
